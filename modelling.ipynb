First of all, in count-vectorizer we can get more explainable results considering that it counts the occurrence of each word and the we can explain the exact meaning for each token. Secondly, we could have used TF-IDF to introduce word importance across the documents, but violations are limited in number and we have enough number of data points in our data. Therefore, I will be using CountVectorizer. As for the parameters of CountVectorizer, removing the stopwords yielded more explanatory n-gram features.**"
